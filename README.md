## Introduction

In the current landscape of language models, achieving high performance in Korean NLP tasks requires specialized instruction datasets tailored to the unique aspects of the Korean language. To address the scarcity of such datasets, we introduce **KIT-19**, a comprehensive Korean Instruction Toolkit that encompasses 19 distinct tasks for fine-tuning Korean Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing datasets that largely rely on translated instructions or outputs from models like ChatGPT, KIT-19 is meticulously crafted to capture the nuances of Korean language and culture, offering a robust foundation for advancing Korean LLMs.

## Overview of KIT-19 Datasets

KIT-19 amalgamates 19 existing open-source datasets, each converted into an instruction format to facilitate instruction tuning for Korean LLMs. Here's a brief overview of the datasets included in KIT-19:
